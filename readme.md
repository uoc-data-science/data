# Programming Data Science

The structure of this repository is as follows:
* _clickstream_ contains the clickstream data and the columns description
* _orders_ contains the orders data and the columns description
* _scripts-python_ contains all python scripts
* _scripts-R_ contains all R scripts

This repository contains the __data__ used for the group work. Please clone this directory and use it as a starting point. Expand the directory structure and everything else just as you wish. Try putting everything under source control, and use concepts like feature branches, pull requests, and code review to collaborate.

At the end of the semester raise a pull request (this acts as the submission).
