# Introduction

This project report is about the webshop of the company ebuy. It is based on two data sources covering some clickstream and some order transactions of the webshop. Additionally, the company provided us with data of an experiment on recommender systems. Based on this data, interesting correlations should be found and useful predictions inferred. Hence, the data is prepared.<br>
First, the data import is described alongside basic information on the data. In this step, the data is also cleaned for further analysis (Chapter [Data Preparation]). Next, the data is summarized and visualized to get an impression on how the data looks like and what could be done with the data (Chapters [Visualization] and [Summary Statistics]). After that, the prediction models are presented (Chapter [Prediction]). One based on the clickstream and one based in the orders. Finally, the experiment data is evaluated to find the best recommender system (Chapter [Experiment]).

# Data Preparation

This part is rather technical and focuses on showing how the data for analysis is generated from the raw data. You may skip this part and continue with the part on [Basic Data Description].

## Data Import {#getdata}

Before any visualization or even analysis can take place, the data has to be imported, cleaned and prepared. The import includes the extraction of the zip archives and reading in the data. In the read-in process, the different candidates for NULL values are transformed to a representation of missing data. This includes empty cells, question marks, NULL fields, NA fields and Nan fields. Furthermore, the headers are matched with predefined data of a separate file.

```{r dataImport, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# prepare column name list
headersFile = file(headersPath, "r")
headersFile2 = file(headersPath2, "r")
#headerNames <- list()
#http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/How-to-read-plain-text-documents-into-a-vector-td901794.html
obj_list <- readLines(headersFile)
obj_list2 <- readLines(headersFile2)

#To convert to a vector, do the following:
result <- stri_extract_first(obj_list, regex="[A-z ,]+")
result2 <- stri_extract_first(obj_list2, regex="[A-z ,]+")
dtype <- stri_extract_last(obj_list, regex="[A-z ,]+")
result <- gsub(" ", "_", result)
result2 <- gsub(" ", "_", result2)


order_df <- read_csv(dataPath, col_names = result, na=c("", "?", "NULL", "NA", "Nan"), guess_max = 3400)

click_df <- read_csv(dataPath2, col_names = result2, na=c("", "?", "NULL", "NA", "Nan"), guess_max = 15000)
click_df2 <- read_csv(dataPath3, col_names = result2, na=c("", "?", "NULL", "NA", "Nan"), guess_max = 20700)
```

Initially, the data consists of `r length(click_df)` features in the clickstream data. While the first dataset carried `r length(click_df[[1]])` observations, the second consists of another `r length(click_df2[[1]])`. Those two are merged in the next step. </br>
In the order dataset, there are `r length(order_df)` columns and `r length(order_df[[1]])` observations.

```{r mergeClick, cache=TRUE}
click_df <- rbind(click_df,click_df2)
```


## Basic Data Description

Starting off with the clickstream data, it ranges from `r min(click_df$Request_Date)` to `r max(click_df$Request_Date)`. It consists of all individual requests made by people accessing the webshop. So, it contains basic information on the request, meaning which site was requested, when it was requested and some technical information on the request. Apart from that, each observation also contains the session information. That means that there exists a portion of requests that belong to one session of a customer. The session variables save the information where the first request was made. Next to metadata, the rows also contain the level the customer currently visits. Whenever a product is visited, the observation in clickstream contains information about that product, too. </br></br>
Unfortunately, the order data covers a different timeframe than the clickstream data. It ranges from `r min(order_df$Order_Date)` to `r max(order_df$Order_Date)`. Further, order data has a similar structure. Each row is an item contained in an order. This means that it has unique metadata, such as an identifier and which product is selected with which amount. On top of that, there is shared metadata for order items that are bought together within one shopping tour. For the products, similar metadata is given in the clickstream table. Apart from the data that is directly related to the order, there is also customer related data which describes properties of the customer. For example, there is a column containing the gender of the customer and whether he/she owns a car. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the observation had a good cover on answered customer questions. This made the customer question unsuitable for prediction and statistical analysis.

## Data Cleaning
```{r variableConfiguration, cache=TRUE}
# Parse Order Time
order_df$Order_Time <- parse_time(order_df$"Order_Line_Date_Time",format="%H\\:%M\\:%S")

# Parse Click Time
click_df$Request_Date_Time <- paste(click_df$Request_Date,click_df$Request_Date_Time)
click_df$Request_Date_Time <- parse_datetime(click_df$Request_Date_Time,format="%Y-%m-%d %H\\:%M\\:%S")
```

Getting to _data manipulation_, a few things within the datasets had to be fixed.

```{r cleaningFunctions, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
cleanNas <- function(x){
  df2 <- x %>% replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x %in% c("?", "NULL"))
  ## dataframe <- str_replace_all(dataframe, ";", ",")
  return (df2)
}
dropEmptyRowsAndCols <- function(x){
  return(x[rowSums(!is.na(x)) > 0,colSums(!is.na(x)) > 0])
}

dropcounter <- 0
dropDuplicateCols <- function(x)
{
  drop <- vector()
  k <- 1
  for (i in 1:ncol(x)) {
    col_i = colnames(x)[i]
    for (j in i+1:ncol(x)){
      col_j = colnames(x)[j]
      if(identical(x[[col_i]],x[[col_j]])) {
        # print(paste(col_i,col_j,sep=" = "))
        drop[k] <- i
        k <- k + 1
        dropcounter <- dropcounter + 1
      }
    }
  }
  temp <- x[, !colnames(x) %in% drop]
  return(temp)
}
deleteSemicolons <- function(x)
{
  return(gsub(";","",x))
}
deleteBackslashs <- function(x)
{
  return(gsub("\\\\","",x))
}
dropColumnsPercNA <- function(x, percentage)
{
  lengthX <- length(x[[1]])
  k <- 0
  drop <- vector()
  for (i in 1:ncol(x))
  {
    col_i <- colnames(x)[i]
    if(((lengthX - sum(is.na(x[col_i]))) / lengthX) < percentage)
    {
      drop[k] <- col_i
      k <- k+1
    }
  }
  temp <- x[, !colnames(x) %in% drop]
  return(temp)
}
```

```{r dataCleaningOrder, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
order_df <- order_df %>% 
  cleanNas() %>%
  dropEmptyRowsAndCols()

order_df$Estimated_Income_Code <- deleteSemicolons(order_df$Estimated_Income_Code)

time_list = c(
  order_df$Order_Date_Time,
  order_df$Promotion_Object_Modification_Date_Time,
  order_df$Last_Retail_Date_Time,
  order_df$Verification_Date_Time,
  order_df$Last_Update_Date_Time,

  click_df$Cookie_First_Visit_Date_Time,
  click_df$Assortment_Modification_Date_Time,
  click_df$Session_First_Request_Date_Time
  )

for (time in time_list) time <- deleteBackslashs(time)


```


```{r dataCleanclick, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Clean click_df
click_df <- click_df %>% 
  dropEmptyRowsAndCols()

click_df$LeadsToBuy <- click_df$Request_Template == "checkout/thankyou\\.jhtml"
```

1. Empty rows/observations and columns/features are removed.
1. Column names included spaces that become problematic in later analysis. They are simply replaced by underscores.
1. All semicolons within cells are simply erased.
1. Besides, backslashes within cells are erased as well.

In addition to the cleaning tasks, further columns were created. Particularly important is the column "LeadsToBuy" which is a boolean column being `TRUE` whenever a clickstream interaction leads to the buying of products. This is realized by comparing the requested site with a special other site that only occurs after a checkout has been completed.

```{r sessionDataframe, cache=TRUE}
ave_Session_df <- click_df %>%
  select(Session_ID,Request_Sequence,Request_Processing_Time,Request_Query_String,Request_Referrer,Request_Date,Request_Date_Time,
         Request_Assortment_ID,Request_Subassortment_ID,Request_Template,REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK,LeadsToBuy,Session_First_Request_Day_of_Week,
         Product_ID,Session_First_Request_Hour_of_Day,Session_User_Agent)%>%
  group_by(Session_ID)%>%
  summarise(Request_count = max(Request_Sequence),
            Session_duration_mins = difftime(max(Request_Date_Time),min(Request_Date_Time),units = c("mins")),
            Visited_assortments = length(unique(Request_Assortment_ID)),
            Referrer=last(Request_Referrer),
            Session_day=first(REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK),
            Visited_products =length(unique(Product_ID)),
            LeadsToBuy = sum(LeadsToBuy) > 0,
            Session_day_2 = first(Session_First_Request_Day_of_Week),
            Session_hour = first(Session_First_Request_Hour_of_Day),
            Visited_Products_List = paste(Product_ID, collapse = ",")
            )
  
ave_Session_df$Session_duration_mins <- as.numeric(ave_Session_df$Session_duration_mins)

# inserted Referrer for ML
ave_Session_df$Referrer <- sapply(ave_Session_df$Referrer,str_extract,pattern="[[:alpha:]]+\\\\\\.([[:alnum:]]+)\\\\\\.[[:alnum:]]+")

ave_Session_df$Referrer<- replace_na(ave_Session_df$Referrer, "none")

ave_Session_df$Referrer <- as.factor(ave_Session_df$Referrer)
```

To be able to look at aggregated data across sessions, a dataset consisting of sessions is created. It contains session duration, visited products, whether a session leads to the purchase of a product and a list of all visited products.

# Visualization

```{r prepForVis, echo=FALSE}
# Clean order_df
# Selected Column Indices
sel <- c("Order_Session_ID","Order_Date","Order_Time","Order_ID","Order_Status","Order_Amount","HowDidYouHearAboutUs","City","US_State","Year_of_Birth","Customer_ID","Estimated_Income_Code","Gender","Order_Credit_Card_Brand","BrandName","Product_Object_ID","Assortment_ID")
sel2 <- c("Session_ID","Request_Sequence","Request_Processing_Time","Request_Query_String","Request_Referrer","Request_Date","Request_Date_Time","Request_Assortment_ID","Request_Subassortment_ID","Request_Template","REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK","Product_ID")

or <- select(order_df,sel)
cl <- select(click_df, sel2)

# Get rid of semicolons
or$Estimated_Income_Code <- gsub(";", "", or$Estimated_Income_Code)
```

On a first look, the data provides the following information:

```{r summary_cl, echo=FALSE}

# --- Features --- #
cl$Request_Week <- as.Date(cut(cl$Request_Date,
  breaks = "week",
  start.on.monday = TRUE))
cl$Daypart <- cut(hour(ymd_hms(cl$Request_Date_Time)), c(0,6,12,18,Inf), c("Overnight (0-6AM)", "Morning (6-12AM)", "Afternoon (12AM-6PM)", "Prime (6PM-0AM)"))

# --- Graphs --- #
g <- ggplot(cl, aes(Request_Date)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Daypart)) + labs(x = "Request Date", y = "Number of Requests")
plot(g)

# --- Counters --- #
count_3 <- count(cl, Request_Date == "2000-04-27")[2,2]
```

Within the clickstreams it can be observed that there is one day, April 27, with far more than average requests (`r count_3`). The amount of requests in the morning is far above average on this day. <br>
The remaining requests are distributed relatively equally and also do not show any anomalies concerning daypart.

```{r summary_or, echo=FALSE}
# --- Features --- #
or$Order_Week <- as.Date(cut(or$Order_Date,
  breaks = "week",
  start.on.monday = TRUE))
or$Daypart <- cut(hour(hms(or$Order_Time)), c(0,6,12,18,Inf), c("Overnight (0-6AM)", "Morning (6-12AM)", "Afternoon (12AM-6PM)", "Prime (6PM-0AM)"))

# --- Graphs --- #
g <- ggplot(or, aes(Order_Date)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Daypart)) + labs(x = "Order Date", y = "Number of Orders")
plot(g)

# --- Counters --- #
count_1 <- count(or, Order_Date == "2000-03-01")[2,2]
count_2 <- count(or, Order_Week == "2000-02-28")[2,2]
temp <- count_2 / count(or)
count_2_p <- percent(temp[1,1])
```

This graph shows that most of the orders were placed at March 1, namely `r count_1`. `r count_2` or `r count_2_p` of all orders have been placed in the week of February 28.<br>
Further, interestingly the amount of orders of March 1 placed overnight or in the morning is quite high. It could be assumed that there was a special time limited offer in the early hours of March 1.<br><br>
Overall, only `r count(or, or$Gender)[3,2]` customers specified their gender as "male" and `r count(or, or$Gender)[2,2]` as "female". However, men seem to spend more money on average as the boxplot indicates.


```{r grammarofg, echo=FALSE}
#x = as.POSIXct(paste(or$Order_Date, or$Order_Time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# ggplot(or) +
#   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Order_Time, y = Order_Amount, color = Gender))

or$Estimated_Income_Code <- factor(or$Estimated_Income_Code, levels = c(
  "Under $15000", "$15000-$19999", "$20000-$29999", "$30000-$39999", "$40000-$49999",
  "$50000-$74999", "$75000-$99999", "$100000-$124999", "$125000 OR MORE"
))



boxplot(Order_Amount~Gender, data = order_df, horizontal = TRUE, xlab = "Order Amount", ylab = "Gender")
#boxplot(Order_Amount~Estimated_Income_Code, data = order_df, par(mar = c(12, 5, 4, 2)+ 0.1), las = 2)

```

Of course, this graph can be misleading, assuming that the male customer spending more than $500 skews the distribution but the information is nice anyways.<br>


Another valuable information is the location of the customer.

```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE}
# 260719
order_map <- select(order_df, "US_State")
order_map$count <- 1
order_map <- aggregate(order_map$count, by = list(order_map$US_State), FUN = sum)
order_map$state <- order_map$Group.1

plot_usmap(data = order_map, values = "x", lines = "black") +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Number of Orders", label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

Besides the fact, that the clickstream data and the order data cover different time ranges we compared both datasets. Therefore, we calculate the number of clicks per product from the clickstream dataset and the number of purchases from the order dataset. We compared the distribution of both via a Lorenz curve. Although the result might be compromised by the time gap the Lorenz curve still shows interesting insights about the distribution of clicks and purchases per product. 

```{r lorenzkurve_clicksvspurchases , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
buffer1 <- click_df %>%
  select(Product_ID,Session_ID) %>%
  group_by( Product_ID) %>%
  summarise(numberofclicks = n())

buffer <- order_df %>%
  select(Product_ID,Order_Line_Quantity)%>%
  group_by(Product_ID)%>%
  summarise(numberofpurchases = sum(Order_Line_Quantity))
buffer <- filter(buffer,!is.na(numberofpurchases))

product_clicks_purchases <- merge(buffer1,buffer,by="Product_ID",all = TRUE)
product_clicks_purchases <- filter(product_clicks_purchases,!is.na(numberofclicks))
product_clicks_purchases <- filter(product_clicks_purchases,!is.na(numberofpurchases))
product_clicks_purchases <- filter(product_clicks_purchases,!is.na(Product_ID))

totalclicks <- sum(product_clicks_purchases$numberofclicks)
totalpurchases <- sum(product_clicks_purchases$numberofpurchases)

product_clicks_purchases <- product_clicks_purchases %>%
  select(Product_ID,numberofclicks,numberofpurchases) %>%
  group_by(Product_ID)%>%
  summarise(numberofclicks = numberofclicks,click_perc = numberofclicks/totalclicks,numberofpurchases = numberofpurchases, purchases_perc = numberofpurchases/totalpurchases)

library(ineq)
G <- rep(10,10)
G_kum <- c(0,cumsum(G/100))
G1 <- product_clicks_purchases$purchases_perc
G1_kum <- c(0,cumsum(product_clicks_purchases$click_perc/100))
D1 <- Lc(G1, n = rep(1,length(G1)), plot = FALSE)
p <- D1[1]
L <- D1[2]
D1_df <- data.frame(p,L)
xx <- c(G_kum,rev(G_kum))
yy <- c(G1_kum,rev(G_kum))
koordinaten <- as.data.frame(xx)
koordinaten$yy <- yy[1:22]
gini <- round(ineq(G1) * 100, digits = 1)
p1 <- ggplot(data=D1_df) +
  geom_point(aes(x=p, y=L)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=p, y=L), stat = "identity", color="#990000") +
  geom_polygon(data = koordinaten, aes(x = xx, y = yy), fill = rgb(255,100,0,55,maxColorValue=255)) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.9, y = 0.1, label = paste("Gini =", gini), size=3, colour="gray30") +
  geom_abline()+
  labs(y="Number of Purchases per Product",
       x="Number of Clicks per Product",
       title = "Product: Clicks vs. Purchases")
p1

```

The curve illustrates, that the distribution among clicks and purchases are _uneven_. A handful of products revive most of the clicks but account only a small order amount. On the other hand, products with a high purchase quantity account only small numbers of clicks. It might be that products which lead customers to your webshop are not the products these customers purchase.

# Summary Statistics

In order to show important summary statistics, there are tables in the following paragraphs showing the respective top 5 results from the tables. The first dataset to look at is the clickstream dataset.

## Clickstream table

```{r Clickstreamtables , echo=FALSE}
buffer<- click_df %>%
  select(Session_ID,Request_Query_String,Request_Referrer,Request_Assortment_ID,Request_Subassortment_ID,Request_Template,REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK,
         Product_ID)%>%
  group_by(Session_ID)

buffer$Request_Referrer<- str_split(buffer$Request_Referrer,"/")

buffer$Request_Referrer <- sapply(buffer$Request_Referrer,grep,pattern="www",value=TRUE,invert=FALSE)

buffer$Request_Referrer<- replace_na(buffer$Request_Referrer)

buffer$Request_Referrer <- as.character(buffer$Request_Referrer)

buffer <- buffer %>%
  select(Request_Referrer,Session_ID) %>%
  group_by(Request_Referrer) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Referrers = n())

buffer <- filter(buffer,Request_Referrer != "NA")

buffer <-buffer[order(-buffer$Number_of_Referrers),]

Session_top5 <- buffer[1:5,1:2]

buffer<- click_df %>%
  select(Session_ID,Product,Product_ID) %>%
  group_by(Product)%>%
  summarise(Click_on_Product = n())

buffer <- filter(buffer,!is.na(Product))
buffer <-buffer[order(-buffer$Click_on_Product),]

Session_top5[1:5,3:4] <- buffer[1:5,1:2]


buffer <- click_df %>%
  select(Session_ID,REQUEST_HOUR_OF_DAY) %>%
  group_by(REQUEST_HOUR_OF_DAY) %>%
  summarise(Clicks_per_hours = n())

buffer <-buffer[order(-buffer$Clicks_per_hours),]


Session_top5[1:5,5:6] <- buffer[1:5,1:2]


buffer <- click_df %>%
  select(Session_ID,REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK) %>%
  group_by(REQUEST_DAY_OF_WEEK) %>%
  summarise(Clicks_per_day = n())

buffer <-buffer[order(-buffer$Clicks_per_day),]

Session_top5[1:5,7:8] <- buffer[1:5,1:2]

names(Session_top5)<- c("Referrer","Number_of_Referrers","Product","Clicks_on_Product",
                      "Top_Click_Hours","Clicks_per_Hour","Top_Click_Days","Clicks_per_Day")

Session_top5 <-as.data.frame(t(Session_top5))
names(Session_top5)<- c("Top 1","Top 2","Top 3","Top 4","Top 5")

kable(Session_top5)
```

This table shows the clickstream datasets. It contains `r nrow(click_df)` click observations. We identified the top five referreing sites which are shown above. Most are counted for the "gazelle.com" website with 93730 refers. This is a very clear first place and it also contains most of the clickstream data. </br>
Among the products, the clicks are a lot more equally distributed. The most favorite product is the Cellulite Trimming Gel with 321 clicks. Compared to the overall number of observations this seems to be very little but in clickstream observations all intermediate steps are contained as well, resulting in less actual products being clicked. </br>
The favorite hour of the day for clicking on this webshop is 2 AM. This is an interesting insight, as it might help improve the site to match customers that browse the webshop at night. The other hours are mainly in the morning between 7 and 11 AM. </br>
Regarding weekdays, obviously the weekend is most common with being among the top three. Interestingly, Friday is not one of the top five clicked days.

## Session Table

```{r Sessiontable, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(W=ave_Session_df$Request_count,X=ave_Session_df$Session_duration_mins, Y=ave_Session_df$Visited_assortments, Z=ave_Session_df$Visited_products) # fake data
summary_stats <- df %>% # start with data frame, and then ...
  summarize_at(
    .vars = c("W","X", "Y", "Z"), # select variables that should be in the table
    .funs = funs(min, max, mean, median, sd) # which summary statistics do you want?
  ) %>% 
  gather(key, value) %>% # transpose everything, and then ...
  separate(col=key, sep="_", c("summary_stats", "stat")) %>% # make two columns out of var name
  spread(key=stat, value=value) # reapeated obs into multiple columns

summary_stats$summary_stats <- c("Request_count","Session_duration_mins","Visited_assortments","Visited_products")

kable(summary_stats) 
```

The session dataset consists of `r nrow(ave_Session_df)` session observations. As can be seen in the median for the request count, at least 50 % of the sessions do not consist of more than one observation. Logically, the shortest session duration is zero, as this metric can only be calculated by looking at the first and the last request time. Accordingly, most sessions also do not look at more than one product and at more than one assortment.

## Order tables

The first table shows, similar to the clickstream data, the top five elements of selected categories.

```{r Ordertables, echo=FALSE}

As indicated in the table, not all products are associated with a product name. For this purpose, the top product identifiers are listed to provide this information for later interpretation. Further, while some customers purchase several times single items, others purchase many items at once. The second aggregation includes all preceding purchases which means that, for example, the customer with the identifier 30208 ordered 30 times but only one item at a time. This results in 30 items in the "purchased products per customer" row. </br>
The by far most popular brand is `AME`, followed by `Silk Reflections` and `ELT`.</br>
The top sale hours are, in contrast to the click hours, rather in the afternoon. But as is apparent, all values are close to each other - meaning that the difference between the hours is not high. Looking at most popular days for purchase, Wednesday is clearly on top. Here, the difference to the clickstreams is more noticable because the weekend comes almost in last place for purchase.</br>
The following table is based on a subset of the order data: All orders that are marked as a return.

The table "Summary_Return" is based on `r nrow(ave_Return)` return observations. Clearly, there are not a lot of observations for this category of orders, thus this summary table is a little less meaningful than the others above. </br>
The following table is based on all orders that have a ordered quantity larger than zero to improve the representativeness of summary statistics for the actual orders.

                                 "Creditcard_Payment_Amount")
kable(summary_Order) 


```

The table "Summary_Order" is based on `r nrow(ave_Order)` order observations. What can be retrieved is that most people order the product at least twice as shown by the order quantity median. Most people also use a promotion which means that promotions have a large impact on purchases. The negative minimum in the row Order Amount looks suspicious. Research in the data revealed that the orders: order-Id 12314 and order-Id 10930 used a special combination of products and the promotion code FRIEND to generate a negative order amount.  However, the credit card payment amount indicates that the coups did not succeed. Also, the datasets cannot tell if the negative order amount was created willingly or by accident.

# Prediction

## Predict on Clickstream

Using the session dataset, the idea is to predict whether a customer is going to buy something at the end of the session based on available metadata. Therefore, useful features are selected, namely the session duration, the session day, hour and the referrer. With this basic dataset, there is an issue with the session duration. As mentioned earlier, it is not possible to calculate a session duration for sessions with just one request. For that reason, all entries with only one request are dropped. </br>

Remaining are `r sum(temp$LeadsToBuy == "Yes")` positive and `r sum(temp$LeadsToBuy == "No")` samples. To cope with the class imbalances, for modelling a downsampled and an upsampled version of data is created to even out the classes. Then, a logistic regression and a naive bayes classifier are trained on both datasets, the up and downsampled version. To increase generalization performance, five repeats of 10-fold cross validation are run. The results for the ROC, the sens and the spec can be found in the following table.

The table shows that the models with the upsampled dataset outperform the downsampled datasets. The difference between naive bayes and logistic regression is that the sensitivity and the specificity differ quite a lot. Deciding, which model suits the business context best depends on the business context. The logistic regression offers a higher sensitivity, thus detects the people _who want to buy_ better. On the other hand, the naive bayes model is better at finding those customers that _do not want to buy anything_. So, we have two different but well performing models with a similar ROC value for usage on the website.

## Predict on Orders
To make your company able to improve customer loyalty, we built an induction tree model that separates the one-time ordering customers from more time ordering customers. The underlaying assumption is that more time buyers are more value. We used a tree model since, compared with other models the findings can be communicated low-tech within our company. The rules separating the customers can be looked up at the induction tree graphic. The prediction model and the findings enable your company to target those customers which more likely place a second order. This leads to a better marketing fund utilization and a stronger customer loyalty.

library(rpart.plot)

# split training and test datasets

trainset <- totalset[1:(nrow(totalset)*0.8),]
testset <- totalset[(nrow(totalset)*0.2):nrow(totalset),]
```

In order to train the decision tree, we created a dataset out of the order dataset, which only includes the first orders of all customers and a label if the order was followed by at least one other order. This dataset contains `r nrow(buffer)` first order observations of which `r nrow(buffer3)` observations are more time buyers and `r nrow(buffer4)` observations are one time buyers.

```{r moretimebuyer_firstmodel ,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#build first model and show tree
fit <- rpart(moretimebuyer~.
             ,data = trainset,method = "class",
             control = rpart.control(xval = 10,minbucket = 5))
rpart.plot(fit,type = 1,extra = "auto")
```

The first tree indicates, that the credit card payment amount is a strong indicator for predicting wheter someone is a more time buyer or not. The splitting rule, the classification, the probability of classification, and the percentage of entities at a point are listed at each splitting point. A probability below 0.5 means the prediction is one-time buyer and a probability above 0.5 means the model predicts more time buyer. The tree is obviously not suitable for communication within our company due to the complexity. Also, the tree is likely to suffer from being overfitted to the training dataset.  

```{r moretimebuyer_firstmodel_testresults,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#show testset results
prediction <- as.data.frame(predict(fit,testset,type = "prob"))
prediction[,3:3] <- testset[,13:13]
prediction[,4:4] <- testset[,8:8]
names(prediction)[1] <- "False_probability"
names(prediction)[2] <- "True_probability"
kable(head(prediction))
```

The table above is a sample of the prediction results and the test-dataset. The first two columns list the instances' probability to be a one-time buyer as `FALSE` probability and more time buyer as `TRUE` probability. The third and fourth column list the actual label and the credit card payment amount of each instance.   

```{r moretimebuyer_firstmodel_cm ,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# show confusion matrix 
Confusion_matrix <- predict(fit,testset,type = "class")
buffer1 <- table(testset$moretimebuyer,Confusion_matrix)
modelaccuracy <- round((sum(diag(buffer1))/sum(buffer1)),4)

kable(modelaccuracy,col.names = "model accuracy",label = NA )

kable(table(Confusion_matrix,testset$moretimebuyer),caption = "Confusion_matrix",label = NA)
```

In order to evaluate the model, we use overall accuracy and a confusion matrix. Despite complexity, the first tree is doing a fair prediction on the test-dataset but the model is far better in identifying one-time buyers than more time buyers. This is probably caused by the small amount of more time buyer observations in the training set. Still, the model is doing a far better job than random guessing where the accuracy would be around 50%.

```{r moretimebuyer_firstmodel_fit,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
plotcp(fit)
kable(fit$cptable)
```

In order to avoid overfitting, the cross-validation error from the first tree is used to build a second tree. The graph shows the cross-validation error vs. the model complexity. The cross-validation error is used to find the optimal complexity and this complexity is used to prune the second tree.
 
```{r secoundtree,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# build secound tree
cp = fit$cptable[which.min(fit$cptable[,"xerror"]),"CP"]
lastcp = fit$cptable[which.min(fit$cptable[,"CP"]),"CP"]

if (cp == lastcp) {
  cp = fit$cptable[nrow(fit$cptable)-1,"CP"]
}



fit.pruned <- prune(fit,cp = cp ,control = rpart.control(xval = 10,minbucket = 6))
rpart.plot(fit.pruned,type = 1,extra = "auto")

```

The second tree is less complex then the first one. As before, the splitting rule, the classification, the probability of classification, and the percentage of entities at a point are shown for each splitting point. Again, a probability below 0.5 classifies as one-time buyer and a probability above 0.5 more time buyer. The main benefit of the second tree is the _simplification_, which makes it easier to communicate findings and to use them as a competitive advantage for sales or marketing campaigns.

```{r moretimebuyer_secoundmodel_cm ,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# show confusion matrix 
Confusion_matrix <- predict(fit.pruned,testset,type = "class")
buffer1 <- table(testset$moretimebuyer,Confusion_matrix)
modelaccuracy <- round((sum(diag(buffer1))/sum(buffer1)),4)

kable(modelaccuracy,col.names = "model accuracy" )


kable(table(Confusion_matrix,testset$moretimebuyer),caption = "Confusion_matrix")
```

The performance of the second tree is slightly worse than the performance of the first tree. It is listed as overall accuracy and as a confusion matrix above. Nevertheless, the prediction is still better than random guessing. Further, since the main aim of the second model is simplified communication of the findings, the small reduction in performance is a fair tradeoff. Overall the second tree combines good prediction with a less complex model. 

```{r moretimebuyer_secoundmodel_results ,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#show testset results
prediction <- as.data.frame(predict(fit,testset,type = "prob"))
prediction[,3:3] <- testset[,13:13]
prediction[,4:4] <- testset[,8:8]
prediction[,5:5] <- testset[,10:10]
prediction[,6:6] <- testset[,11:11]
names(prediction)[1] <- "False_probability"
names(prediction)[2] <- "True_probability"

result <- filter(prediction, True_probability>0.8)

kable(result)

```

One way to mine the results of the prediction tree would be to rank instances by the True probability and target instances above a certain threshold. As above, with a threshold of 0.8 True_probability. Another approach is to train customer support personnel, sales personnel, and marketing personnel with the second induction tree model to give them a better understanding of profitable customers. This will enable our employees to target these customers directly. Both suggested methods can be applied by itself or together.

## Experiment

_Recommender Systems_<br>
For the website's recommender systems, there are different options. In an experiment, three different recommender systems were tested:

1. A random recommendation system as baseline comparison for the experiment
1. A ranking based recommender system 
1. A profit-oriented recommender system

The data consisted of 146 observations for the profit-oriented system, 149 for the random one and 154 observations for the ranking based system.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8}

headersPath <- "experiment/experimental_results.csv"
experiment <- read_csv(headersPath)
# plot data
library(reshape2)
plotData <- subset(experiment, select=c("random_recommendations","ranking_based","profit_oriented"))
plotData <- melt(plotData)
ggplot(plotData) %>%
  + geom_density(aes(x=value, color = variable),adjust=.8) %>%
  + scale_colour_manual(name="Recommender System", labels=c("Random", "Ranking Based", "Profit Oriented"), values=c("red","green","blue")) %>%
  + labs(x = element_text("Average Sales per Person"),       # Change x axis title only
         y = element_text("Density of Occurance")       # Change y axis title only
         )
```

As can be seen in the figure, with some smoothing the profit-oriented recommender system seems to be much more effective, offering both a higher mean value and a lower standard deviation. To prove this point, the t-tests are calculated for the combinations of both systems on the random recommender system and between the ranking and profit oriented recommender system.

```{r p__value, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
profExp <- t.test(experiment$profit_oriented, experiment$random_recommendations, alternative="greater", paired=TRUE)
rkgExp <- t.test(experiment$ranking_based, experiment$random_recommendations, alternative="greater", paired=TRUE)
profRkg <- t.test(experiment$profit_oriented, experiment$ranking_based, alternative = "greater", paired=TRUE)
# Build Table with values

p.value <- profExp[["p.value"]]
tabpvalue1 <- as.data.frame(p.value,"profit_oriented and random_recommendations")


p.value <- rkgExp[["p.value"]]
tabvpalue2 <- as.data.frame(p.value,"ranking_based and random_recommendations")


p.value <- profRkg[["p.value"]]
tabvpalue3 <- as.data.frame(p.value,"profit_oriented and ranking_based")



tabpvalue <- rbind(tabpvalue1,tabvpalue2,tabvpalue3)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
t(tabpvalue)

```


The t-test shows that the profit-oriented recommender system is indeed significantly better than the random recommendation system. Furthermore, it performs also significantly better than the ranking based recommender system, making it the best of the three. To sum up, the best system to use is the _profit-oriented recommender system_, because it is able to outperform the other candidates statistically significantly.




# Conclusion

The most interesting findings in your data should be summarized. <br>

* Most orders were placed on the 1st of march. In the week beginning at the 28th of February also 56% of all observed orders were made. 
* On average men seem to have a higher order amount than women. In addition, the highest order amount was also placed by a man, but women have more outliers concerning order amount. 
* Clicks and purchases are distributed unevenly over our products. It could be that products with high amounts of clicks promote the products with a high amount of purchase.
* The top referrer is www.gazelle.com. Further, intertesting is that the product with the highest number of clicks it "Cellulite Trimming Gel", but the number of clicks is distributed mostly evenly over your top 5 products.
* The favorite hour for clicks on your webshop is 2 AM and most clicks are placed over the weekend.
* The average session indicates that most visitors only look at one site of the webshop and one product. 
* The most ordered product is the product with the ID 12883. Unfortunately, the names for all top 5 products are missing. Fortunately, most of the orders include brand names. The best-selling brand is "AME" far with 822 purchases.
* In contrast to the top click days the top days for orders are mostly weekdays. In terms of orders Wednesday is leading with 934 orders. 
* In the average order the most interesting finding is the negative order amount. Research in the data revealed that the orders: order-Id 12314 and order-Id 10930 used a special combination of products and the promotion code "FRIEND" to generate a negative order amount. Further investigation is recommended here. Anyway, the average credit card payment amount indicates that the coups did not succeed.

The _prediction_ resulted in the following:<br>
Our first prediction model uses the session metadata to predict whether a customer is going to buy something at the end of the session. A Naive bayes model and a logistic regression have been trained twice one time with down sampled and one time with up sampled dataset for this purpose.   Which model is more suitable for Realtime prediction on your webshop depends on your business needs. The logistic regression model is better in detecting people who want to buy. On the other hand, the naive bayes model is better in finding the customer who do not want to buy anything. Though the prediction on the order dataset we discovered that one strong indicator separating one-time buyers from the more time buyers is the Credit Card Payment Amount. This discovered rule and the other rules are shown in the prediction tree. The rules can be used to gain a competitive advantage. One way to do so is to use the prediction model on order of new customers. Another is to train your employees with the tree so they can target customers, which are more likely to do another order. The accuracy of the tree can be improved with additional observations of more time buyers first orders. The evaluation of the Recommender Systems shows that the profit orientated recommender system performed best out of the three Random, Ranking and Profit orientated.
